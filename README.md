#Before you contribute

Asking questions here is fine...but when you ask questions here and anywhere on the Internet to avoid people from getting angry with you, heed the advice laid out in http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Referral links are not allowed. I Will delete them if I see them -- if it becomes a persistent problem, you will be banned. A referral link is one which gives you some benefit for other users signing up for a service -- wanna share a cool new service, share a link to their homepage WITHOUT the referral code in the URL The reason for this rule is so that the group doesn't get clogged with everybody sharing Amazon Student links.
Be specific, post code to a pastebin...

Posting of fiver links will lead to an immediate ban. No exceptions. These are commonly associated with scammers. Spam and you will be banned immediately and without warning. Posting interesting links is allowed however...in fact it's encouraged..posting spam links is not allowed. Use your judgement...we don't have too many rules here.
